<h3>Building things that work, learning things that matter.</h3><hr>

Hi, I’m Mangesh — a Computer Engineering student and full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into real web applications.
From HTML, CSS, JavaScript to Node.js, Express, MongoDB, I enjoy exploring all layers of technology and crafting solutions that are clean, efficient, and scalable. 🌐✨

Lately, I’ve been diving into Data Science 📊 — combining development and data to create smarter systems and meaningful insights. Every project is a challenge I enjoy, every line of code a step forward.

I focus on learning, improving, and building projects that actually make an impact. 🚀
Open to collaborations, new challenges, and creating things that matter. 🤝💡
